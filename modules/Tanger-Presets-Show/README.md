Drawing Spells
</h1>

Drawing Spells is a prompt query tool for anime/game characters, designed for use with AI image generation.

Both Illustrious and NoobAI-XL are highly advanced AI drawing models. Even without using LoRA, as long as the prompts contain the correct character names and clothing descriptions, thousands of anime/game characters can be accurately generated.

This project does not require a server. After downloading the project, simply open `index.html` in your browser.

## Tips

- Some users may prefer specific attributes. For example, regardless of the character's original hairstyle, you may always want to change the character to have long hair.<br>
If you have this need, you can use the "Ignore Prompts When Copying" feature in Advanced Settings.<br>
Add prompts related to hairstyles such as `short hair, *ponytail, twintails, horse tail,` etc.<br>
This allows you to quickly copy only the prompts you want.

- All settings are recorded in the URL, so you can share your search results just by sharing the link, like [this](#/?page=1&include=1girl%0Ahonkai%3A+star+rail&exclude=&sort=default&pageSize=50&excludeCount=1&ignorePrompts=1girl%2C).

- The default sorting is by series/work. If you enjoy gacha draws, you can set the sorting method to `random`.
